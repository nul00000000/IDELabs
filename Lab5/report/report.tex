\begin{abstract}
An essential part of modern electronics is the ability to interact with
analog voltages that arise from sensors. Important parts of interpreting
these signals are using timers and ADCs (Analog to Digital Converters) to
sample the analog data into digital data. Demonstrating these concepts was
accomplished by enabling the proper peripherals on a MSP432 microcontroller,
these being the ADC and Timer32 modules, and programming the microcontroller
to sample temperature and light sensors, using the Timer32 module
as a clock, and the ADC to receive analog data. Data was processed and
visualized in tests to ensure that the analog sampling was performed as
expected. These tests utilized MatLab to visualize digital conversions,
which were compared to a waveform recorded on an oscilloscope.
\end{abstract}

\section{Design Methodology}

\subsection{Usage of Timers}
In order to accurately sample many external sensors, a clock signal must be 
used to synchronize the outputs of the sensor and the inputs of the ADC in
the microcontroller. Although a clock signal is necessary, the
microcontroller's internal clock would be a poor choice of a signal to use
for this purpose, as inputs would be received at the same pace that the
processor can execute instructions. Instead, timer interrupts were used to
reduce the main clock signal to a significantly slower and more usable
frequency. A Timer32 module of the MSP432 was used for this purpose.

The Timer32 module was used to generate interrupts at a rate of 2Hz and
1kHz, with the 2Hz signal being used to toggle an LED, and the 1kHz signal
being used to measure time between button presses in milliseconds. The 2Hz
signal was also used to trigger data collection from a temperature sensor,
so that the program would receive updated data two times a second.

% part 1 end

Before constructing the final form of the circuit which would take input from a line-scan camera, a more simple ADC circuit was constructed. For this circuit, a temperature sensor was connected to the MSP432 board via extension wires.

Before constructing the circuit which would be used to test the opto-isolator and measure its output, the correct resistor values
had to be determined from the OPB745 datasheet along with the anticipated voltage values. In doing this, an expected "shape" for the
voltage and current graphs could be determined which allowed for verification as testing was conducted. The resistor value was
calculated according to the equation shown below.

\begin{equation}
    R_F=\frac{5V-V_{LED}}{I_{F_{MAX}}}=\frac{5-1.7}{0.04}=\frac{3.3}{0.04}=82.5\Omega
\end{equation}

As shown in Equation 1, the required resistor value for the LED is 82.5$\Omega$. This value is based on the total voltage through the
circuit (5V) and the voltage drop across the LED (1.7V as specified by the datasheet).

Another important part of the design was determining the expected values and pattern of an output from the photo-transducer. This was
done by examining the OPB745 datasheet which contained a graph of the output current at different distances from the reflective source.
A table of these values is shown in Table \ref{tab:expectedvoltagecurrent}

With the current values (labeled in Table \ref{tab:expectedvoltagecurrent} as $I_{RL}$), the voltage value can be calculated by simply applying Ohm's Law (V = IR) as the resistance value is also known (10k$\Omega$).

With this information, an expected output graph can be created. This is displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:expectedvoltage}.

Fig.~\ref{fig:expectedvoltage} shows what how the output voltage may change as a reflective material is moved further away from the
sensor. The results of an experiment will not exactly match the graph, but should align with the general shape. Of particular
importance is a high starting voltage followed by a steep drop almost immediately which then climbs to maintain a steady value
marginally below the starting supply voltage.

From Table \ref{tab:expectedvoltagecurrent}, the current was also mapped against the distance from the reflective surface.
The resulting plot is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:expectedcurrent}.

Similarly to Fig.~\ref{fig:expectedvoltage}, it is not expected for the exercise output to exactly match 
Fig.~\ref{fig:expectedcurrent}, however, the general shape is important. The current behaviors inversely to the
voltage and starts at 0 before quickly spiking to a peak before leveling off slightly above 0.

To determine whether the expected results defined in Fig.~\ref{fig:expectedvoltage} and Fig.~\ref{fig:expectedcurrent} would remain true
in a laboratory test, the following circuit was created.

The circuit in Fig.~\ref{fig:circuit_1} is relatively simple and consists of a 5V power supply placed in parallel with two branches.
The first contains a resistor $R_f$ and the LED side of the photo-transistor. This is what actually emits the light. The resistor is
important as it limits the current flowing through the LED, ensuring that the diode isn't damaged. The value was calculated in
Equation 1. On the second branch, the resistor $R_L$ acts as a load which is connected in series with the transistor side of the
OPB745. It is across this transistor that the voltage defined as "$V_{out}$" is measured.

Slight modifications were made to the circuit in Fig.~\ref{fig:circuit_1} to test the OPB745 with inverters added to the circuit.
This is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:circuit_2}.

While the circuit in Fig.~\ref{fig:circuit_2} is very similar to that in Fig.~\ref{fig:circuit_1}, two inverters were added along
with a function generator. The location of the voltage probe was not changed relative to the first circuit, but the addition of the
74LS14 chip results in the waveform output being inverted. The second chip, a 7406, is placed in series with the output of the function
generator to invert the input waveform signal.

\section{Results and Analysis}

\subsection{Timer and Port Interrupts}

Before testing other systems, it was first necessary to test that the timer
modules were behaving as expected. To test the 2Hz timer interrupts, the
program was flashed onto the MSP432 development board and tested manually.
The intended behavior of a button enabling and disabling a LED to flash at
2Hz was demonstrated, showing the correct operation of the interrupts. To
test the 1kHz interrupts, a program was written to count an amount of
milliseconds between two presses of a button. This program output the amount
of time measured to a UART serial terminal when a second button press was
detected. This results of this test are shown in Fig.~\ref{part1terminal}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth,decodearray={1 0 1 0 1 0}]{images/part1terminal.png}
    \caption{UART Output from Interrupt Testing}
    \label{part1terminal}
\end{figure}

These tests also confirmed that the port interrupts were functioning
correctly. The port interrupts were executed when the switches on the
MSP432 board were interracted with, allowing them to toggle the flashing
of the LED as well as telling the program when to start and stop the
counting of the 1kHz timer. Both of these functions were performed
successfully during these tests.

%end part 1

As a result of testing the circuit with various reflection distances, it was able to be
determined what an ideal testing distance would be, using both a 10k$\Omega$ and 20k$\Omega$ resistance. 
The results of these tests are shown in Table \ref{distanceVoltageCurrent}.

Table \ref{distanceVoltageCurrent} demonstrates the relationship between the reflection distance
from the infrared diode to the phototransistor in the optoisolator, and the voltage and current across the
phototransistor. This relationship is slightly different when the circuit contains a 10k$\Omega$ resistor
and a 20k$\Omega$ resistor. The voltage relationships are shown more clearly in Fig.~\ref{distanceVoltageFigure}.

Fig.~\ref{distanceVoltageFigure} shows the voltage in both cases start at near the
logic high voltage and immediately drop, and then rise more
gradually back up to about 0.5 or 1.0 volts lower, for the
10k$\Omega$ case and 20k$\Omega$ case respectively. From these
voltage values, a current relationship could also be calculated
by subtracted $V_{out}$, that being the voltage across the
phototransistor, from the logic high voltage of 5 volts, which
gives the voltage across the resistor, and then using Ohm's law
to determine the current by dividing by the resistance. The
outcome of these calculations is shown in Fig.~\ref{distanceCurrentFigure}

    \caption{Distance of Reflective Surface from OPB745 vs Current}
    \label{distanceCurrentFigure}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{distanceVoltageFigure} and Fig.~\ref{distanceCurrentFigure}
show the relationship between the distance of the reflective
material and the voltage and current associated with the
phototransistor in the OPB745. This data demonstrates three
stages within the relationship. 

When the voltage across the phototransistor is high and
the current through it is low, this means that the phototransistor is
less active, and a low voltage and higher current means
the phototransistor is more active. Therefore, in the first
stage, where the voltage is very high and the current is very
low, it is clear that the phototransistor is receiving almost
no light from the infrared diode. This is due to the fact
that the reflective coating is so close that the light from
the diode cannot escape the OPB745, leading to very little entering
the phototransistor.

In the next stage, the reflective material is far enough
from the OPB745 to allow light to exit, and due to the close
proximity, much is reflected directly into the phototransistor.
This causes the low voltage and high current seen in the data
after the dropoff from the first stage.

When the reflective material is moved far enough from the
device to allow reflected light to scatter to areas
other than the phototransistor, the voltage quickly rises and
the current falls. The values settle at a level that is
less extreme than the initial near-complete occlusion of
the phototransistor, as some light still reaches it.

\subsection{Comparison to Expectations}
The measured outputs of the circuit do not match fully with what was expected based upon
the datasheet of the OPB745. For visual comparison, data from Fig.~\ref{fig:expectedvoltage} and Fig.~\ref{distanceVoltageFigure}

    \caption{Measured and Expected Output Voltages of OPB745}
    \label{fig:expectedAndRealVoltage}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:expectedAndRealVoltage} provides a visual comparison between the measured and expected
outputs of the OPB745 at varying distances from a reflective surface, and demonstrates that there is
a sizable difference between them. There are two primary differences between the graphs, both relating to
the area where most light is reflected. In the expected data, the dip falls to a negative voltage across
the phototransistor, whereas in the measured data, the output voltage only falls to about 0.7 volts. This is
due to the fact that in ideal circumstances, the phototransistor would flow enough current that the voltage
drop across the resistor is greater than 5 volts, leading to a negative current across the phototransistor.
In the real world circuit, loss of light and possible current limiting causes the voltage to stop decreasing before
crossing zero.

The other major difference is the difference in range over which this voltage drop occurs. The OPB745 datasheet
assumes a flat reflective surface, however the aluminum foil used in this setup has a slightly altered affect.
This may be due to a slightly convex circuit allowing a greater range of distances to reflect light in the
correct spot. Although it appears that the bottom of the voltage drop has a flat response over this section
from approximately 2mm to 6mm, it may be that the voltage would have gone lower and was only stopped by
the phototransistor's physical characteristics, and so does not necessarily imply a steady amount of light
received by the phototransistor.

\subsection{Usage with Digital Logic}

In order for the OPB745 to be used as an isolator in a digital
circuit, the output must be interpreted as a digital signal.
This was done by passing the output through an 74LS14 
Schmitt-trigger inverter, as
well as feeding the input diode with the output of an 7406
inverter. In steady state with working components, this circuit
will behave as intended. However, due to the partially analog
nature of the circuit, there is a switching frequency where
this correct digital behavior begins to break down. The circuit
was fed with a switching signal with both the input and output voltage
monitored by a oscilloscope. The maximum operable frequencies using
10k$\Omega$ and 20k$\Omega$ resistors were
recorded in their working state and shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:maxFreq10k} and Fig.~\ref{fig:maxFreq20k} respectively.

    \caption{\textit{Maximum Switchable Frequency with 20k$\Omega$ Resistor}}
    \label{fig:maxFreq20k}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:maxFreq10k} demonstrates that the circuit with the 10k$\Omega$
resistor operated at a maximum frequency of about 700Hz, while Fig.~\ref{fig:maxFreq20k}
demonstrates that the circuit with the 20k$\Omega$ resistor could operate at only 400Hz.

\section{Questions}

\subsection{Why do the IRQ flags need to be cleared in the interrupt service
routine functions?}

The IRQ flags need to be cleared in the ISR function due to the fact that
these flags are the way that the NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller)
keeps track of interrupt conditions and therefore which interrupts are pending and need to be executed. If
a flag is not cleared, the ISR will be executed repeatedly, unless some other
code or interrupt with a higher priority clears the flag.

\subsection{When an interrupt occurs, how do you know which pin caused it?}

In order to find what pin caused an interrupt, the IFG register of the port
that the interrupt came from can be checked. The pin that caused the
interrupt will have its respective bit of the IFG register set since it had
a pending interrupt. At the end of the ISR, it is essential to clear this
bit.

\subsection{What is the startup sequence of SI and CLK to initiate data 
transfer from the Camera?}

The clock signal, CLK, is used to latch the SI signal, and as such, the SI
signal must not be changed on a clock edge to aboid metastability. To
initiate a scan, SI goes high before the rising edge of the clock signal.
Once the rising edge arives, the SI signal must go low before the next
rising edge of the clock. This sequence starts a capture, and each subsequent
rising edge moves through a single pixel on the output. Eventually, the end
of the frame is reached, and SI must pulse high again in order to begin
another capture and data transfer.

\section{Conclusion}


Through the course of this exercise, the properties of the OPB745 were shown and its behavior was compared between a laboratory
setting and the expected values shown on the datasheet. Because the measured results of the tests showed similar characteristics and
patterns to that of the datasheet's values, the exercise can be deemed a success. In the future, the OPB745 can be used to detect changes
in an environment without requiring contact, something which will be immensely helpful in developing autonomous car technology. It was
necessary, however, to understand how the device functions before it could be put to use in more specialized applications.
