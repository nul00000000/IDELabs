\begin{abstract}
An essential part of modern electronics is the ability to interact with
analog voltages that arise from sensors. Important parts of interpreting
these signals are using timers and ADCs (Analog to Digital Converters) to
sample the analog data into digital data. Demonstrating these concepts was
accomplished by enabling the proper peripherals on a MSP432 microcontroller,
these being the ADC and Timer32 modules. The microcontroller was programmed
to sample temperature and light sensors using the Timer32 module
as a clock and the ADC to receive analog data. Data was processed and
visualized in tests with a line scan camera to ensure that the analog sampling
was performed as expected. These tests utilized MATLAB to visualize digital
conversions, which were compared to a waveform recorded on an oscilloscope.

\section{Design Methodology}

\subsection{Usage of Timers}
In order to accurately sample many external sensors, a clock signal must be 
used to synchronize the outputs of the sensor and the inputs of the ADC in
the microcontroller. Although a clock signal is necessary, the
microcontroller's internal clock would be a poor choice of a signal to use
for this purpose, as inputs would be received at the same pace that the
processor can execute instructions. Instead, timer interrupts were used to
reduce the main clock signal to a significantly slower and more usable
frequency. A Timer32 module of the MSP432 was used for this purpose.

The Timer32 module was used to generate interrupts at a rate of 2Hz and
1kHz, with the 2Hz signal being used to toggle an LED, and the 1kHz signal
being used to measure time between button presses in milliseconds. The 2Hz
signal was also later used to trigger data collection from a temperature sensor,
so that the program would receive updated data two times a second.

\subsection{Analog to Digital Conversion}
%fixed comma grammar and the word "practice" as if its a lab (it is but womp womp)
Before constructing the final form of the circuit, which would take input from
a line-scan camera, a more simple ADC circuit was constructed. To demonstrate
analog to digital conversion, a temperature sensor was connected to the
MSP432 board via extension wires.

%fixed tense and name and informal words
%using parentheses like that in a formal paper is a crime punishable by 
%probably like -a million points (or death)
The temperature sensor was much less complicated than a line-scan pixel camera,
but still presented some challenges. The first was polling the information
from the device via the ADC. This required code which would configure one of
the ADC clusters on the microcontroller to enable a temperature sensing
application. Two important parts of the configuration that had to be set were the
reference voltage, which was set at 2.5V in accordance with the
MSP432 datasheet, and the interrupts which were completely disabled on the ADC
itself.

%fixed whatever that sentence was
%the digitized voltage was not raw technically i think
The ADC interrupts were not used for obtaining its data due to the fact that
their frequency would have caused significantly more data reads than
necessary. Instead, the Timer32 module was used to generate interrupts at
a more reasonable frequency of 2Hz, in which data was read from the ADC.
Once the raw data from the temperature sensor was converted to a digital value
through the ADC hardware, conversions had to be performed, this time in
software, to output a human-readable temperature in degrees Centigrade and
Fahrenheit. The equation for converting the digitized voltage to Celsius
is shown in Equation 1.

%fixed the equations
\begin{equation}
    T_C = analogIn / 142.46 - 10
\end{equation}

%fixed things associated with equations and removed mentions of types which
%were lowkey not relevant
%who has ever used the word "proclaim" thats like saying "perchance"
In Equation 1, $T_C$ is the floating point variable storing the current
temperature in degrees Centigrade and $analogIn$ is the direct digitized analog
input from the ADC, ranging from 0 to 2\textsuperscript{14} - 1.
The two constants in Equation 1 come from the
temperature sensor datasheet which claims a range of the device between
10째C and 125째C. The maximum value was divided by the maximum voltage value of
the ADC (3.3V) to determine a scaling factor which was then applied to the
analog input. The subtraction of ten accounts for the range offset beginning
at 10째C rather than 0째C.

Once the value was expressed in degrees Centigrade, the conversion to
Fahrenheit was trivial and is shown in Equation 2.

\begin{equation}
    T_F = \frac{9}{5}(T_C) + 32
\end{equation}

In Equation 2, $T_F$ is degrees Fahrenheit. This mathematical operation is
simply a direct conversion of degrees Centigrade to degrees Fahrenheit. First
multiplying by $\frac{9}{5}$ and then adding 32.

\subsection{Line Scan Camera}
%circuit instead of circuitry
%not sure if translation is the best word but I can't think of anything else
Once the Timer32 module had been properly configured along with the ADC
circuit, the two parts could be brought together to function as a
translation for the line scan camera.

%im being petty here but thats what soldavini does so 5 big booms
This device outputs a 128 segment vector which contains the light level of
each segment. Using this, it is possible to detect dark spots and to create a
binary map of what the camera is viewing.

%more formal
To create this, the setup was straightforward, consisting largely of
interfacing with the previously configured Timer32 and ADC modules. The
camera had to be connected to the microcontroller with jumper wires which connected
3.3V, GND, CLK, SI, and AO.

%little word changes
Each of these signals served a different purpose and were connected to a different
pin in the microcontroller. 3.3V and GND provided the power to the camera
to actually take in data. CLK was connected to the SysTickTimer module which
was configured at 200Hz and was responsible for pulsing the camera rapidly. SI
is the scan signal and determines when the camera will actually scan in the
information. These two signals work together with the CLK pulsing 129 times
between each SI pulse which ensures that all of the segments are properly
scanned. Finally, the AO value is what the camera outputs as an analog signal
representing all segments in the scan.

The AO signal is the camera's only output and is what is connected to the
microcontroller's ADC for further processing. Some of this processing involves
MATLAB code which smooths the signal and converts the fluctuations into a
simple digital output.

%bro described the definition of smoothing
%more evil evil parentheses
%"light" and "dark" more like bite and bark if you use quotes like that
%the "formula" you speak of is a number
These two functions are relatively straightforward. Smoothing is done by
averaging every five bits of information which has the effect of limiting the
impact of outliers and acting as a low pass filter. The binary
conversion examined the AO signal and used a threshold, determined in this
case to be roughly half of the full range, to
determine whether the value should be considered light or dark. 
This threshold will need to be
recalculated every time the camera is introduced to a new environment in order to
account for different lighting conditions.

\section{Results and Analysis}

\subsection{Timer and Port Interrupts}

Before testing other systems, it was first necessary to test that the timer
modules were behaving as expected. To test the 2Hz timer interrupts, the
program was flashed onto the MSP432 development board and tested manually.
The intended behavior of a button enabling and disabling a LED to flash at
2Hz was demonstrated, showing the correct operation of the interrupts. To
test the 1kHz interrupts, a program was written to count an amount of
milliseconds between two presses of a button. This program output this 
number to a UART serial terminal when the second button press was
detected. This results of this test are shown in Fig.~\ref{part1terminal}.

    \caption{UART Output from Interrupt Testing}
    \label{part1terminal}
\end{figure}

These tests also confirmed that the port interrupts were functioning
correctly. The port interrupts were executed when the switches on the
MSP432 board were interacted with, allowing them to toggle the flashing
of the LED as well as telling the program when to start and stop the
counting of the 1kHz timer. Both of these functions were performed
successfully during these tests.

\subsection{ADC Temperature Sensor}

%stop yapping my brother
With the Timer32 module successfully verified, the analog to digital 
conversion also had to be checked. It was important to
determine whether the ADC module had been configured correctly in terms of
inputs and interrupts. The terminal output resulting from connecting the
temperature sensor to the microcontroller and then converting and translating
the values is shown in Fig.~\ref{part2terminal}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth,decodearray={1 0 1 0 1 0}]{images/part2terminal2.png}
    \caption{UART Output from ADC Testing}
    \label{part2terminal}
\end{figure}

%wording woes
As displayed in Fig.~\ref{part2terminal}, the temperature according to the
sensor was displayed on the screen continuously every half second, corresponding to
the period of the timer module, which triggered an interrupt that read from the
analog input.

%technically TAs arent experts but they are educated individuals
The UART output was slightly incorrect, as the "." character was not printing
properly within the terminal. This may have been a result of some kind of
encoding issue or internal problem to the microcontroller. A discussion with
educated individuals on the matter determined that fixing the
issue was not feasible and stood beyond the scope of what was being tested.

%the entire section isnt graphs
\subsection{Camera Output}

With each of the smaller portions independently verified, the two could
finally be combined in the application of the line scan camera. This device
was tested in multiple ways to ensure that both the hardware and software
setups would produce the same, correct results. To determine the validity of
the hardware setup, the AO jumper wire was connected to an oscilloscope probe
rather than the ADC on the microcontroller. This way, the direct voltage value
could be read and its changes could be observed when the camera was
pointed at different shades. The result of this test while the camera faced 
a point light source is displayed in Fig.~\ref{oscilloscope}

%cropping central
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/part3scope.png}
    \caption{Oscilloscope Capture of the Camera Voltage Output}
    \label{oscilloscope}
\end{figure}

The oscilloscope in Fig.~\ref{oscilloscope} displays two waveforms. The top
waveform is the actual voltage value coming from the camera which in this case
displays a peak in the center with two lower valleys on either side. This
waveform is indicative of what the camera was seeing which was a bright light
in the center, surrounded on both sides by a dark backdrop.

%phrasing n balls
The second, lower line in Fig.~\ref{oscilloscope} does not appear significant,
as any variations are not noticeable. However, its inclusion is essential for the
proper analysis of the camera. This second probe was placed in line with the
SI input in such a way that the input was still able to reach the camera, but
could also be tracked on the oscilloscope. As SI is the signal which controls
when the camera should begin a new scan, setting the oscilloscope to trigger
on a change in SI meant that the top waveform would match
perfectly with one full scan from the camera.

With the oscilloscope to test the hardware, a MATLAB program was used to
verify the software and perform more complicated smoothing and binary
conversions, as previously discussed. The resulting MATLAB graphs are shown in
Fig.~\ref{MATLAB}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/part3MATLAB.png}
    \caption{MATLAB Graphs of the Camera Voltage Output}
    \label{MATLAB}
\end{figure}

%im phrasing crazing
The three graphs in Fig.~\ref{MATLAB} are each a different step of the
simplification process. The top graph is the raw voltage which looks very
similar to that shown in Fig.~\ref{oscilloscope} as expected. 
The smoothed voltage has no sharp
jumps in voltage, and removes point outliers, most notably at 90 and 110 where the dips displayed on the
raw graph have been completely smoothed over. Finally, the binary conversion
plot takes the voltage values and equates them to a binary "1" or "0"
depending on the threshold. Due to how the threshold was set, all values
before the second dip are considered high, while after that is low. As
previously mentioned, this threshold will need to be recalibrated for each %auto or by hand encompasses all possible ways of recalculating and therefore is redundant
new environment that the camera is used in.

\section{Questions}

\subsection{Why do the IRQ flags need to be cleared in the interrupt service
routine functions?}

The IRQ flags need to be cleared in the ISR function due to the fact that
these flags are the way that the NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller)
keeps track of interrupt conditions and therefore which interrupts are pending 
and need to be executed. If a flag is not cleared, the ISR will be executed 
repeatedly, unless some other code or interrupt with a higher priority clears 
the flag.

\subsection{When an interrupt occurs, how do you know which pin caused it?}

In order to find what pin caused an interrupt, the IFG register of the port
that the interrupt came from can be checked. The pin that caused the
interrupt will have its respective bit of the IFG register set since it had
a pending interrupt. At the end of the ISR, it is essential to clear this
bit.

\subsection{What is the startup sequence of SI and CLK to initiate data 
transfer from the Camera?}

The clock signal, CLK, is used to latch the SI signal, and as such, the SI
signal must not be changed on a clock edge to avoid metastability. To
initiate a scan, SI goes high before the rising edge of the clock signal.
Once the rising edge arrives, the SI signal must go low before the next
rising edge of the clock. This sequence starts a capture, and each subsequent
rising edge moves through a single pixel on the output. Eventually, the end
of the frame is reached, and SI must pulse high again in order to begin
another capture and data transfer.

\section{Conclusion}
Throughout the process of configuring a timer module, then an analog to 
digital converter, then finally combining the two for a camera, each step 
built upon the last and utilized elements which had been set up previously. 
Jumping straight to the camera would have been exceedingly difficult without the
earlier testing completed and any issues with those components ruled out. The
camera's operation itself is also incredibly important to understand, both in 
how it gathers data and how to process that information. The line scan is a 
unique way of interpreting the world, but now that it is understood, along 
with how to simplify the information gathered into more actionable data, the 
camera can be successfully put to more advanced uses.
