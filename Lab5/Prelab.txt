Investigate how to Enable the ADC, which is ADC A6 and be able to explain:
	ADC14ENC = 0 to change control values
	Reset the ADC with ADC14ON = 0, then = 1
	Select clock with ADC14SSELx (HSMCLK or SMCLK)
	Divide clock by 4 (01b) with ADC14PDIV
	Divide clock by 4 (011b) again (for 16 total) with ADC14DIV
	Set reference voltage with ADC14VRSEL to VCC for full scale
	Set power mode on ADC14PWRMD to 00b for regular
	Use ADC14RES bits in ADC14CTL1 to set resolution
	ADC14ENC = 1 before conversion can take place

Investigate how to Read result from ADC A6 and be able to explain:
	Wait for ADC14IFG0 interrupt flag to read
	Use the ADC14MEM0 to ADC14MEM31 (098 to 114)
	Interrupt will clear after
