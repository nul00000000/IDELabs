Part 1
a) Maximum stall torque before reduction: 4.5kgcm/30 = 0.15kgcm = 2.083oz-in
b) max current draw = 1.4 A
c) max turn speed before reduction = 0.21 kRPM * 30 = 6.3 kRPM
d) maximum torque after reduction: 4.5kgcm = 62.49 oz-in
e) max turn speed after reduction = 0.21 kRPM

Part 2
a) The diodes in this circuit provide a safe path for the current so that it doesn't go through the transistors and destroy them. 
This is particularly a problem when the power is removed from the motors and the voltage spikes.
b) The capacitor minimizes spikes both upwards and downwards. It can absorb voltage when it spikes and discharge 
energy when voltage dips. This can occur when there is a direct path from +V to ground.
c) By creating the H-bridge with two transistors, it is possible to control both the direction of the motor and supports separate 
driving and control voltages. This is very advantageous for many applications and helps make the circuit much more versatile.
d) Two different transistors are used because one is an NPN while the other is a PNP. This means they are open or closed based 
on opposite voltages. It is this property and setup that allows for control of the direction as a single voltage change can both 
open and close current paths. The different transistor models exist due to the 2N transistors having faster switching times
for lower power applications, and the TIP transistors can handle higher power applications.
